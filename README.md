Step-1

The "div" tag in HTML functions as a versatile container, allowing grouping of content elements for styling and layout purposes. It aids in structuring and organizing components within web pages. Its attributes can be utilized with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced design and interactivity.

height: 100vh;
This rule sets the height of the element to occupy 100% of the viewport height, ensuring it covers the entire visible area of the screen.

width: 100%;
I'm making sure that the element spans the full width of its container, taking up the entire available horizontal space.

background-color: #D3D3D3;
I've chosen a background color with the hexadecimal value #D3D3D3. This shade gives the element a light gray background that can enhance its visual appeal.

padding-left: 7.5%;
To create some spacing within the element, I'm adding a left padding of 7.5%. This space helps in maintaining a proper layout and prevents content from touching the edge.

padding-right: 3%;
Similarly, I've added a right padding of 3% to ensure there's a comfortable distance between the content and the right edge of the element.

padding-top: 8%;
For some vertical spacing, I've applied a top padding of 8%, which adds space between the content and the top of the element.

padding-bottom: 2%;
To finalize the spacing, I've included a bottom padding of 2%, ensuring there's some distance between the content and the bottom of the element.

overflow: hidden;
With this rule, I'm preventing any content that extends beyond the element's boundaries from being visible. This can help maintain a neat appearance.

position: relative;
I've set the positioning of the element to be "relative," which means its positioning will be relative to its normal position within the document flow.

z-index: 1;
To control the stacking order of elements, I've assigned a z-index value of 1. This can be helpful if there are other elements with different z-index values that need to be layered properly.

The "div" tag in HTML functions as a versatile container, allowing grouping of content elements for styling and layout purposes. It aids in structuring and organizing components within web pages. Its attributes can be utilized with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced design and interactivity.

CSS:

background: linear-gradient(to right,rgb(183,44,41), rgb(122,65,97), rgb(24,100,189));
I've used a linear gradient as the background for the element. The gradient flows from left to right, transitioning between three different colors: a reddish hue, a purplish shade, and a bluish tone. This creates an appealing and colorful background effect.

height: 100%;
I've set the height of the element to 100%, ensuring it covers the entire height of its container. This allows the gradient background and other styling to extend fully from top to bottom.

width: 100%;
Similarly, I've set the width of the element to 100%, making it span the entire available width of its container.

transform: skewY(10deg);
I've applied a skew transformation to the element, specifically skewing it along the Y-axis by 10 degrees. This creates a slanted effect, adding an interesting visual dimension to the element.

position: absolute;
I've positioned the element absolutely, which means it's taken out of the normal document flow and can be positioned anywhere within its closest positioned ancestor.

top: 0px;
To place the element at the top edge of its container, I've set its top position to 0 pixels. This ensures the skewed gradient background starts from the very top.

left: 0px;
Similarly, I've set the left position to 0 pixels, ensuring the skewed gradient background starts from the left edge of its container.

z-index: -1;
By giving the element a z-index of -1, I'm positioning it behind other elements with positive z-index values. This helps in creating a layered visual effect where the gradient background appears behind other content.

box-shadow: 0 0 12px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
I've added a box shadow to the element, creating a subtle shadow effect. The shadow has a spread of 12 pixels and is slightly offset in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The shadow's color is a slightly transparent black (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)), contributing to a sense of depth and contrast against the background.

height: 95%;
I've set the height of the element to 95% of its containing element's height. This ensures that the element takes up most of the available vertical space while leaving a little room at the bottom.

width: 95%;
Similarly, I've set the width of the element to 95% of its containing element's width. This way, the element spans almost the entire available horizontal space.

box-shadow: 0 0 8px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
I've added a box shadow to the element, creating a subtle yet noticeable shadow effect. The shadow is positioned with no horizontal or vertical offset (0 0), has a blur radius of 8 pixels, and a spread radius of 3 pixels. The shadow's color is a semi-transparent black (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)).

background: linear-gradient(to right, #8a2387, #e94057, #f27121);
I've set a linear gradient background that transitions from left to right. The gradient is composed of three distinct colors: a deep purple (#8a2387), a vibrant pink (#e94057), and a fiery orange (#f27121). This creates an eye-catching and colorful background effect.

padding-top: 2%;
I've added a top padding of 2% to create some space between the content within the element and its top edge. This helps maintain a comfortable distance and layout.

padding-left: 2%;
Similarly, I've applied a left padding of 2%. This padding ensures that the content within the element doesn't touch the left edge, providing a bit of space for better readability and aesthetics.

For #p1:

color: white;
I've set the text color of the element with the ID p1 to be white. This will ensure that the text content inside this element appears in a white color.

height: 25%;
I've set the height of the element with the ID p1 to be 25% of its containing element's height. This will make the element occupy a quarter of the vertical space within its container.

width: 39%;
Similarly, I've set the width of the element with the ID p1 to be 39% of its containing element's width. This width percentage defines how wide the element will appear on the page.

margin-top: 2.5%;
I've added a top margin of 2.5% to the element with the ID p1. This creates some spacing between this element and any content or elements above it.

font-size: 18px;
I've set the font size of the text content within the element with the ID p1 to be 18 pixels. This will ensure that the text is easily readable and has a consistent size.

For #p2:

color: white;
I've set the text color of the element with the ID p2 to be white. Like with the previous rule, this ensures that the text inside this element is displayed in white.

height: 10%;
The height of the element with the ID p2 is set to 10% of its containing element's height. This element will be relatively smaller in terms of vertical space compared to the previous one.

width: 39%;
The width of the element with the ID p2 is also set to 39% of its containing element's width, ensuring a consistent width with the previous element.

font-size: 18px;
The font size for the text within the element with the ID p2 is set to 18 pixels, just like the previous element. This maintains a uniform font size across both elements.

margin-top: 2%;
I've added a top margin of 2% to the element with the ID p2. This creates a small gap between this element and any content or elements above it, helping to maintain a clean layout.
