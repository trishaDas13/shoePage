The "div" tag in HTML functions as a versatile container, allowing grouping of content elements for styling and layout purposes. It aids in structuring and organizing components within web pages. Its attributes can be utilized with CSS and JavaScript for enhanced design and interactivity.

height: 100vh;
This rule sets the height of the element to occupy 100% of the viewport height, ensuring it covers the entire visible area of the screen.

width: 100%;
I'm making sure that the element spans the full width of its container, taking up the entire available horizontal space.

background-color: #D3D3D3;
I've chosen a background color with the hexadecimal value #D3D3D3. This shade gives the element a light gray background that can enhance its visual appeal.

padding-left: 7.5%;
To create some spacing within the element, I'm adding a left padding of 7.5%. This space helps in maintaining a proper layout and prevents content from touching the edge.

padding-right: 3%;
Similarly, I've added a right padding of 3% to ensure there's a comfortable distance between the content and the right edge of the element.

padding-top: 8%;
For some vertical spacing, I've applied a top padding of 8%, which adds space between the content and the top of the element.

padding-bottom: 2%;
To finalize the spacing, I've included a bottom padding of 2%, ensuring there's some distance between the content and the bottom of the element.

overflow: hidden;
With this rule, I'm preventing any content that extends beyond the element's boundaries from being visible. This can help maintain a neat appearance.

position: relative;
I've set the positioning of the element to be "relative," which means its positioning will be relative to its normal position within the document flow.

z-index: 1;
To control the stacking order of elements, I've assigned a z-index value of 1. This can be helpful if there are other elements with different z-index values that need to be layered properly.
